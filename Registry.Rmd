# Description

The MOD44B Version 6 Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) is an annual data from 2000 to 2020 at 250 m resolution. Each pixel stores percentage of ground cover components. Three components of ground cover: percent tree cover, percent non-tree vegetation and percent bare, are included in separate layers. 

The percents of ground cover are estimates from a machine learning model based on the combination of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ([MODIS](https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/)) data and other high resolution data from NASA and Google Earth. The machine learning model incorporates not only the visible bandwidth but other bandwidth such as brightness temperature (from MODIS bands 20, 31,32). 

The VCF data utilizes thermal signatures and other correlates to distinguish forest and non-forest plantation, which is an improvement compared to the Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI). The Global Forest Cover (GFC) data set also describes deforestation but in a binary fashion. It records baseline forest cover in the year 2000 and includes a binary indicator for the year of deforestation for each 30m × 30m pixel. If over 90% of the forest cover was lost in a pixel by a given year, then the pixel will be marked as deforested, or reforested if the forest cover went from 0 in 2000 to positive. The VCF provide continuous percentage changes in percents of ground components cover which provides more details than the GFC data.
